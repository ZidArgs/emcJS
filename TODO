- REST interface
    - at least GET/POST
    - predefine url, leave placeholders
    - fill placeholders on send request

- Storage-Model-System
    - have a storage model containing fields and types

- Types (self casting types)
    - integer
    - float
    - date
    - ...

- Toast, PopOver, etc.
    - create one interface for all
    - create on top responsive overlay for all notifications
        - set sections
        - multiple notifications...
            - dont stack
            - sections can expand
        - blend in and out (transitions)
        - limit notification count (?)
            - buffer notifications and show them after another went down
    - create multiple layer, set target element for interface
        - body is not ideal for everything
